    I was born and raised in Alexandria where I have lived all my life, currently I am living alone.  I have always been very interested in computer science, and  by studying physics and mathematics, I had the opportunity of studying all combination of these three subjects. Currently, I work as a research and teaching assistant at mathematics and computer science department at Faculty of Science, which is quite ideal for me because I'm very passionate about learning new topics in computer science and communicating the acquired knowledge to students. 
%    A typical day of work could either be spent doing wavelet extraction on seismic data
%    or writing a munin plugin to various services on the servers. 
    
        In my free time,  I enjoy sports. I'm a regular weightlifter; I hit the gym about 5 days per week, and swimming classes and basketball training about two times a week. Beside sports, I love reading novels, especially horror and science fiction genres. My favorite authors are Stephen King, Joe Hill and Douglas Adams.
